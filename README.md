# Fibonacci_Sum_SE282_2024_As2
Program for SOFTENG 282 Assignment 2.


    // By solving the recurrence relation a_(n+1) = a_(n+1) + a_n,
    // the following solution of the Fibonacci sequence has been found:
    // a_n = (1/sqrt(5)) * ( ((1 + sqrt(5)) / 2)^n - ((1 - sqrt(5)) / 2)^n )
    // where n is an integer and n >= 0.
    
    // We can use this formula to efficiently calculate F(n).
